- Images - from Pexels.com

### Project Overview
This project consisted on creating an index.html page that links to three other html pages. Each of these contains a recipe written using HTML.

All pages where created usign the terminal commands, such as **touch index.html** for example. The same for the directories, **mkdir images**. After each file was created, it was then developed on VS Code.

Git commands where used for version control and commit changes.

Lastly, the project is going to be hosted on GitHub.io for public viewing and review.

### Lessons Learned
- How to create hyperlinks and embed images using HTML.
- Git commits: I did my best attempt at declarative language on each commit message to develop best practices.
- How to start thinking on website strucutre and directories and being organized.
- Getting comfortable using the terminal for file creation and navigation.
